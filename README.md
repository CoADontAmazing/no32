## Project
> **No32** is **a client-side mod** for Minecraft that **allows a 32-bit OS to isguise itself as a 64-bit one**. 

***The mod changes the method that checks the device for a 64-bit OS to one that will always return true. This allows you to get rid of the banners or notifications that your device is 32-bit or that a 32-bit device may not be supported by Minecraft in the future.***

> [!WARNING]
> **No32 may cause errors or problems**. 

Opposite mod [No64](https://modrinth.com/mod/no64)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The mod **works only on the client side**.
