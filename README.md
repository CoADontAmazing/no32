## General
**No32** is a mod for Minecraft that **allows a 32-bit OS to isguise itself as a 64-bit one**. ***The mod changes the method that checks the device for a 64-bit operating system to one that will always return true. This allows you to get rid of the banners or notifications that your device is 32-bit or that a 32-bit device may not be supported by Minecraft in the future.***


**No32 may cause errors or problems**.


The mod **works only on the client side**.
